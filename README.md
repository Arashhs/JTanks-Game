# JTanks-Game
JTanks is a 2D tank game made in java for the final project of my Advanced Programming course written
at the end of my freshman year at university.
- Both multiplayer and single-player modes are implemented as well as a text-based map editor
- A balanced loot-based system is implemented with various power-up items - varying from weapon-upgrades to reducing damage taken by the player
- Featuring three different difficulty settings (Easy, Normal, and Hard) which impacts the maps, enemies, and the amount of damage taken by the player in the game
- The project is based on Buffer-Strategy implementation and uses multi-threading techniques
